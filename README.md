### ðŸ“ŒIntroduction

<h4 align="justify" ><i>Emojis are a small visual representation of emotions or objects that are usually used in text messages to enhance the communication experience between individuals.</i> This project aims to understand the underlying semantics of the text sentence using natural processing techniques to predict reasonable emojis based on the context. With the rise in the widespread use of social media platforms like Twitter and instant messaging, many users are using these emojis in their text messages to convey broad feelings efficiently, which sometimes cannot be expressed using just words. Thus, giving rise to a problem statement that is to identify the relationship between these text messages and the emojis used in them. This project aims to understand the underlying semantics of the text sentence using natural processing techniques to predict reasonable emojis based on the context.
